        <em>Security researchers confirmed that the exploit is being used to place backdoors on a number of SaaS products...</em>

        The new vectors included a technique called "HTTP side-car reverse injection", which allowed the use of “brute forcing techniques and proxy-based hacks.”

        Gerard Manning of <a href="rr.html">The Security Institute of West Canada</a> published a summary of the hack just hours ago: "We were surprised at how easy this exploit was... and nobody noticed it. It's like we weren't even looking for an attack like this one."

        Manning said the initial user-level attack via cross-site scripting (XSS) was attempted by a number of malicious actors in mid-November 2020. After connecting to vulnerable websites, attackers deployed a tool called "AsricStlyProx." But their approach was too complicated. "The real hack was much simpler," Manning said.

        Update: Microsoft is releasing <a href="rr.html">incremental patches</a> for the vulnerability. The company also released a security advisory on the matter, urging customers to patch vulnerable ASP.NET applications as soon as possible.
